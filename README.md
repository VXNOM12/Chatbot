# Chatbot 🤖

## Introduction
Welcome to the simple chatbot project built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Flask. This chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses, and can interact with users through a web interface.

## Features ✨
- 🤓 **Trained on a dataset of intents and responses**
- 🧠 **Uses TensorFlow and Keras for natural language processing**
- 💬 **Responds to user input with relevant responses**

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋
- 🐍 **Python 3.8 or Python 3.9**
- 🔮 **TensorFlow 2.3 or later**
- ⚙️ **Keras 2.3 or later**

### Installation 🛠️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git](https://github.com/VXNOM12/chatbot.git)
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage 🌐
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Type a message in the input field and press send 📨
3. The chatbot will respond with a relevant response 💬

## Dataset 📚
The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses, stored in the `intents.json` file. The dataset consists of a list of intents, each with a list of responses.

## Model 🧠
The chatbot uses a TensorFlow model to process user input and generate responses. The model is trained on the dataset and saved to the `chat_model` file.

## Tokenizer 🔄
The chatbot uses a tokenizer to convert user input into a format that can be processed by the model. The tokenizer is stored in the `tokenizer.pickle` file.

## Label Encoder 🔢
The chatbot uses a label encoder to convert the intents into numerical labels. The label encoder is stored in the `label_encoder.pickle` file.

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments 🙌
This project was built using the following resources:
- TensorFlow and Keras for natural language processing
- Colorama for terminal colors

## Code Structure 🗂️
The code is organized into the following files and directories:
- `app.py`: The main application file, which defines the Flask app and routes.
- `intents.json`: The dataset of intents and responses.
- `chat_model`: The trained TensorFlow model.
- `tokenizer.pickle`: The tokenizer used to convert user input into a format that can be processed by the model.
- `label_encoder.pickle`: The label encoder used to convert the intents into numerical labels.

## Future Development 🔮
- **Improve the accuracy** of the chatbot by training it on a larger dataset.
- **Add more features** to the chat interface, such as user authentication and error handling.
- **Explore** the use of other natural language processing libraries and techniques, such as transformers and attention mechanisms.
